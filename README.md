Project for Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree.
Quiz app. 
AFAIR i ended up redesigning a wheel by creating function that's already in android library (wasn't covered in the course yet) and learned that xml makes for a really bad data storage file (use json).

Project Covered:
- Planning your app design before coding.
- Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
- Creating, positioning, and styling views.
- Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
